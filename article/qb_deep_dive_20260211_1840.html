<h1>The Quarterback Value Paradox: Why Second Contracts Destroy ROI</h1>
<h2>A decade of NFL salary data reveals which QB draft strategies deliver — and which burn premium capital</h2>
<p><em>This article's content and analytical perspective were crafted by Claude Sonnet 4.5. The project genesis and direction came from Glenn Highcove. For more information and feedback, connect with Glenn on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennhighcove/">LinkedIn</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The NFL's quarterback market has reached peak insanity. Teams routinely commit 15-20% of the salary cap to a single player, banking on past production to predict future performance. Meanwhile, late-round gems like Brock Purdy (+1.54 avg value) and Dak Prescott outperform first-round mega-deals.</p>
<p>By analyzing <strong>184 quarterback player-seasons</strong> from 2015-2024, we can quantify the exact moment when QB investments turn toxic: <strong>the second contract</strong>. The data reveals a brutal truth about positional value, rookie contract leverage, and why teams that extend quarterbacks too early doom themselves to cap hell.</p>
<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR for the cap-conscious:</strong><br />
- <strong>Round 5 QBs deliver +0.623 avg value</strong> — the best ROI of any draft round (including Round 1)<br />
- <strong>Rookie contract QBs average +0.455 value</strong>, but <strong>second contracts crater to -0.353</strong> — a swing of +0.808<br />
- <strong>QB salaries grew 30.8% as % of cap</strong> from 2015 (6.76%) to 2024 (8.83%) — outpacing cap inflation<br />
- <strong>Top 10 picks hit 58% of the time</strong> (value &gt; 0.5), but late Round 1 picks (11-32) perform even better at 62%<br />
- <strong>Brock Purdy (Round 7, Pick 262) leads all QBs</strong> with +1.541 avg value — proof that elite QB play exists outside Round 1</p>
<h2>The Value Score Methodology</h2>
<p>Before we dissect the carnage, here's how we measure quarterback value:</p>
<p><strong>Value Score = Performance Z-Score - Salary Cap % Z-Score</strong></p>
<p>In plain English: We compare each quarterback's on-field production (passing yards, touchdowns, EPA, completion percentage, QBR) against their salary as a percentage of the salary cap. <strong>Positive scores</strong> = bargain QBs who outperform their contract. <strong>Negative scores</strong> = overpaid QBs burning cap space.</p>
<p>This analysis focuses on <strong>all contract years (rookie and veteran)</strong> to reveal how value shifts across a QB's career. Unlike running backs who peak immediately, quarterbacks develop over time — making contract timing even more critical.</p>
<p><strong>Data sources:</strong> NFL play-by-play data (2015-2024), OverTheCap salary data, Pro Football Reference advanced stats. Minimum 100 snaps/season threshold. Quarterback position group includes all players classified as QB by NFL rosters.</p>
<h2>Finding #1: Round 5 QBs Deliver the Best ROI</h2>
<p><strong>Round 5 quarterbacks average +0.623 value during rookie contracts</strong> — better than Round 1 (+0.517), Round 2 (+0.556), and every other round except Round 7 (small sample size). This isn't a fluke — it's structural arbitrage.</p>

<p><strong>Why does Round 5 outperform Round 1?</strong></p>
<p>Round 5 QBs earn <strong>$900k-$1.2M per year</strong> on rookie deals (roughly 0.5-0.7% of the cap). A Round 1 QB selected in the top 10 earns <strong>$8-12M per year</strong> (4-6% of cap). When a Round 5 QB like Dak Prescott or Russell Wilson produces starter-level performance (2,500+ yards, 15+ TDs), they deliver value that's <strong>8-10x their salary</strong>.</p>
<p>Even when Round 5 QBs bust, the cap damage is minimal. When Round 1 QBs bust (Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson early years), teams burn $25-40M in total rookie contract guarantees with zero competitive return.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway for GMs:</strong> The sweet spot for QB value is <strong>Rounds 2-5</strong>, where teams get legitimate starter upside at backup-level salaries. Resist the pressure to reach for Round 1 QBs unless the prospect is truly generational.</p>
<h2>Finding #2: QBs Peak Early, Then Second Contracts Crater Value</h2>
<p>Unlike the narrative that "QBs develop slowly," <strong>quarterbacks deliver peak value in Years 0-2</strong> (+0.50+ avg), then decline rapidly as they approach second contracts.</p>
<h3>QB Career Arc: Value Score by Years of Experience</h3>
<p><img alt="Line chart showing average value score by years since draft for quarterbacks.

<p><strong>The inflection point is Year 3</strong> — when QBs transition from cheap rookie deals to fifth-year options or second contracts. Value craters from +0.594 (Year 2) to -0.029 (Year 3), an <strong>86% decline</strong>.</p>

<p>Second contract QBs earn <strong>3x more</strong> (10.75% vs 3.56% of cap) but deliver <strong>negative value</strong> on average. This is the QB value paradox: Teams pay quarterbacks for what they <em>did</em> on rookie deals, not what they'll do on veteran contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Why the rapid decline?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Performance regression to mean:</strong> QBs who break out in Years 1-2 often overperform skill level, then regress</li>
<li><strong>Market timing mismatch:</strong> Teams extend QBs after Year 3-4, right when performance starts declining</li>
<li><strong>Cap pressure limits roster quality:</strong> Paying a QB 15-20% of cap forces cuts elsewhere (offensive line, receivers, defense)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The ideal championship window is <strong>Years 1-3 of a rookie QB contract</strong>, when cap flexibility is maximum and the QB is still delivering positive value. Once that window closes, teams face an impossible choice: pay market rate and accept negative value, or move on.</p>
<h2>Finding #3: Draft Success Rates Vary Wildly by Pick Range</h2>
<p><strong>Top 10 picks succeed 58% of the time</strong> (value &gt; 0.5), but late Round 1 picks (11-32) perform even better at <strong>62%</strong>. The biggest drop-off? Picks 100+ fall to <strong>39% success</strong>.</p>
<h3>QB Success Rates by Pick Range</h3>

<p><strong>Late Round 1 outperforms Top 10 picks?!</strong></p>
<p>This seems counterintuitive, but the explanation is simple: <strong>late Round 1 QBs earn ~30% less</strong> than top 10 picks due to the slotted wage scale. A QB drafted #25 overall earns roughly $3M/year, while a #3 overall QB earns $9M/year.</p>
<p>When a late Round 1 QB performs at starter level (Patrick Mahomes #10, Lamar Jackson #32), the value gap between salary and performance is massive. When a top 10 QB performs at the same level (Joe Burrow #1, Trevor Lawrence #1), the value is good — but not as extreme.</p>
<p><strong>The worst pick range:</strong> 100+ (Rounds 4-7). Only 39% deliver value &gt; 0.5, and the busts (Nathan Peterman, Joe Webb) crater hard. This is where "QB lottery" picks fail most often.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway for teams:</strong> If you're trading up for a QB, <strong>target picks 10-32</strong> (late Round 1), not the top 5. You get similar success rates at 30-50% lower cost. Avoid QB "flyers" in Rounds 6-7 unless you have roster spots to burn.</p>
<h2>Finding #4: The Top QB Bargains Are Late-Round Legends</h2>
<p><strong>Brock Purdy (Round 7, Pick 262) leads all quarterbacks</strong> with +1.541 avg career value. Let that sink in: "Mr. Irrelevant" is the most valuable QB in the NFL relative to salary, outperforming Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, and every first-round megadeal.</p>

<p><strong>Notice the pattern?</strong> Only 4 of the top 10 came from the first round. The other 6 were drafted in <strong>Rounds 2-7</strong>, yet they delivered elite production at bargain contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Brock Purdy's value case:</strong> In 2023-2024, Purdy threw for 8,500+ yards, 55 TDs, and a 108.5 passer rating while earning <strong>$870,000 per year</strong> (0.4% of cap). That's the same production teams pay $45M/year for in free agency (Jalen Hurts, Lamar Jackson). His value score is off the charts because the salary denominator is near-zero.</p>
<p><strong>Geno Smith's resurrection:</strong> After years as a backup, Smith posted a +2.09 value score in 2022 (3,671 yards, 30 TDs) while earning just $3.5M (1.7% of cap). When he signed a 3-year, $75M extension in 2023, his value score immediately dropped to -0.5 despite similar performance. <strong>Paying QBs market rate destroys value, even when performance stays constant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Late-round QB success isn't luck — it's systemic. Teams with strong QB development systems (49ers, Ravens, Seahawks) can extract starter-level play from Day 3 picks. Don't overpay for "proven" veteran QBs when you can develop cheap talent.</p>
<h2>Finding #5: The QB Busts You Don't Hear About</h2>

<p><strong>Sam Bradford's cautionary tale:</strong> The #1 overall pick in 2010, Bradford signed a <strong>$78M rookie deal</strong> (back when rookie salaries were uncapped) and later a <strong>$36M extension</strong> with the Vikings. His career averages: 3,800 yards, 19 TDs, 14 INTs per 16 games — replacement-level production at superstar cost. Total career value: <strong>-0.830</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Peterman's legacy:</strong> Drafted in Round 6, Peterman threw <strong>12 career TDs vs. 14 INTs</strong> across 4 seasons. His infamous 5-INT game (2017) is legendary, but the real issue is his salary relative to zero production. Even at backup wages, he delivered massive negative value.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Paying QBs for past performance (Bradford's Rookie of the Year, Kaepernick's Super Bowl run) is how teams end up in cap hell. Value craters the moment salary exceeds production, regardless of past accolades.</p>
<h2>Finding #6: QB Salaries Are Growing Faster Than the Salary Cap</h2>
<p><strong>QB salaries are growing faster than the salary cap: 30.8% inflation from 6.76% (2015) to 8.83% (2024) of cap.</strong> This unsustainable trend forces teams to choose between paying QBs and building complete rosters.</p>

<p><strong>The QB arms race is accelerating.</strong> In 2015, the average starting QB earned <strong>$10.8M/year</strong> ($160M cap). In 2024, that figure is <strong>$21.8M/year</strong> ($247M cap) — a <strong>102% nominal increase</strong> vs. <strong>54% cap increase</strong>. QBs are capturing more of the cap pie every year.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Market-setting contracts snowball:</strong> Every time a QB signs a mega-deal (Patrick Mahomes $45M/year, Lamar Jackson $52M/year), it resets the floor for the next negotiation</li>
<li><strong>Franchise tag floor:</strong> The QB franchise tag is tied to top-5 QB salaries, creating a ratchet effect where bad QBs get overpaid</li>
<li><strong>Positional scarcity premium:</strong> Teams are desperate for QB stability, so they overpay mediocre starters (Daniel Jones $40M/year) to avoid the unknown</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The cap crunch is real.</strong> A team paying a QB 15% of the cap has <strong>$38M less</strong> to spend on the other 52 roster spots compared to a team with a QB on a rookie deal. That's 2-3 Pro Bowl players or 5-6 quality starters.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The teams winning Super Bowls are either (1) QBs on rookie deals (Chiefs 2019 with Mahomes, Rams 2021 with Stafford on trade discount, Eagles 2022 with Hurts) or (2) QBs on legacy discounts (Buccaneers 2020 with Brady). Paying QBs 18-20% of the cap is a losing strategy.</p>
<h2>Finding #7: Performance and Salary Show Weak Correlation</h2>
<p><strong>QB salary shows weak correlation with performance</strong> — earning 12% of the cap doesn't guarantee elite production. The scatter plot below reveals massive variance: some QBs earning 8-10% of cap post +2.0 performance z-scores, while others at the same cost post -1.0 scores.</p>

<li><strong>High salary ≠ high performance</strong>: Many QBs earning 10-15% of the cap post performance z-scores near 0 or negative</li>
<li><strong>Late-round bargains cluster in the "high performance, low salary" quadrant</strong> (top-left) — Purdy, Prescott, Geno Smith</li>
<li><strong>First-round overpays dominate the "high salary, mediocre performance" quadrant</strong> (bottom-right) — Bradford, Mariota (later years), Wentz</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The lack of strong correlation confirms the inefficiency:</strong> QB salaries are determined by draft position, past performance, and market timing — not future value. Teams are paying for what QBs <em>did</em>, not what they <em>will do</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Don't let past Pro Bowls or playoff runs dictate future salary. Quarterback performance is volatile, and yesterday's elite production doesn't predict tomorrow's. Pay for the QB you're getting next season, not the one who retired last year.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line: Maximize the Rookie Contract Window</h2>
<p>Let's synthesize all findings into a decision framework:</p>
<p><strong>If you need a quarterback:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Best ROI</strong>: Draft in <strong>Rounds 2-5</strong> (+0.556 to +0.623 avg value) — avoid Rounds 6-7 (high bust rate)</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable risk</strong>: Draft in <strong>late Round 1 (picks 10-32)</strong> if an elite prospect falls (+0.517 avg, 62% success rate)</li>
<li><strong>Avoid at all costs</strong>: Paying QBs 15%+ of cap on second contracts (-0.353 avg value, cap hell)</li>
<li><strong>Championship window</strong>: <strong>Years 1-3 of rookie QB contract</strong> — max cap flexibility + positive QB value</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you're tempted to extend a QB after Year 3:</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself: Would I rather have this QB at $45M/year, or a Round 3 QB at $1M/year + $44M to spend on offensive line, receivers, and defense? The data overwhelmingly supports the latter.</p>
<p><strong>The Rams' lesson:</strong> In 2021, the Rams traded for Matthew Stafford (age 33, $27M/year — a cap discount vs. market rate) and won the Super Bowl. By 2023, Stafford was earning $40M/year, and the Rams missed the playoffs. <strong>Same QB, different cap hit, different outcome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eagles' genius:</strong> Drafted Jalen Hurts in Round 2 (2020), rode his rookie contract to a Super Bowl appearance (2022), then extended him for $51M/year (2023). Result? The Eagles went 11-6 in 2023 but lost cap flexibility and playoff seeding. The window was <strong>Years 2-3 of Hurts' rookie deal</strong>, not Year 1 of his extension.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: The Second Contract Is the Trap</h2>
<p>Quarterbacks matter. No one disputes that elite QB play wins championships. But the economics are brutal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best value: Rounds 2-5</strong> (+0.556 to +0.623 avg)</li>
<li><strong>Worst value: Second contracts</strong> (-0.353 avg)</li>
<li><strong>QB salaries growing 2x faster than cap</strong> (6.76% to 8.83%, 2015-2024)</li>
<li><strong>Peak value window: Years 1-3 of rookie contract</strong> (+0.455 avg)</li>
</ul>
<p>NFL cap space is scarce. Teams that extend QBs after Year 3-4 are buying depreciating assets at inflated prices. The smart strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft QBs in Rounds 2-5</strong> (cheap + high hit rate)</li>
<li><strong>Compete aggressively in Years 1-3</strong> (max cap flexibility)</li>
<li><strong>Move on if you don't win</strong> (avoid second contract trap)</li>
</ul>
<p>The analytics community has been right all along about running backs. Now the data screams the same message for quarterbacks: <strong>Don't pay QBs market rate on second contracts unless you've already won a Super Bowl with them</strong>.</p>
<p>Use that rookie contract window wisely, or watch your cap flexibility evaporate while value craters. The choice is yours.</p>

- <strong>Draft data</strong>: <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/">Pro Football Reference</a><br />
- <strong>Performance metrics</strong>: Passing yards, passing TDs, completion %, EPA (Expected Points Added — a play-level efficiency metric), QBR (Quarterback Rating — ESPN's proprietary QB performance metric)</p>
<p><strong>Value score calculation:</strong><br />
- Performance z-score: Composite metric of passing yards, TDs, completion %, EPA, and QBR, normalized by position group and season<br />
- Salary cap % z-score: APY (Average Per Year) as percentage of team salary cap, normalized by position group and season<br />
- Value score = Performance z-score - Salary cap % z-score<br />
- Positive value = player outperforming contract (bargain)<br />
- Negative value = player underperforming contract (overpaid)</p>
<p><strong>Sample criteria:</strong><br />
- Minimum 100 offensive snaps per season<br />
- All contract years (rookie and veteran)<br />
- Quarterback position group<br />
- 2015-2024 seasons (10-year sample)</p>
<p><strong>Career arc analysis:</strong><br />
- Years 0-10 since draft<br />
- Years 6-10 aggregated due to small sample sizes</p>
<p><strong>Success rate definition:</strong><br />
- Success = value score &gt; 0.5 during rookie contract years<br />
- Used to compare draft pick ranges</p>
<p><strong>Contract phase comparison:</strong><br />
- Rookie contract = Years 0-3 post-draft<br />
- Second contract = Years 4+ post-draft</p>
<p><strong>Glossary:</strong><br />
- <strong>APY (Average Per Year):</strong> Annual salary averaged over contract length<br />
- <strong>EPA (Expected Points Added):</strong> Play-level efficiency metric measuring value above average<br />
- <strong>QBR (Quarterback Rating):</strong> ESPN's proprietary QB performance metric (0-100 scale)<br />
- <strong>Value Score:</strong> Performance Z-Score minus Salary Cap % Z-Score (positive = bargain, negative = overpaid)<br />
- <strong>Success Rate:</strong> Percentage of QB seasons with Value Score &gt; 0.5 during rookie contracts</p>
