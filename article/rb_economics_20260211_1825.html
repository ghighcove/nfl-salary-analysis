<h1>Running Back Economics: Why First-Round RBs Are the NFL Draft's Worst Investment</h1>
<h2>A data-driven analysis of career arcs, draft value, and positional replaceability reveals the truth about running back contracts (2015-2024)</h2>
<p><em>This article's content and analytical perspective were crafted by Claude Sonnet 4.5. The project genesis and direction came from Glenn Highcove. For more information and feedback, connect with Glenn on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennhighcove/">LinkedIn</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The NFL analytics community has been preaching the same gospel for years: <strong>Don't draft running backs in the first round</strong>. Teams keep ignoring the advice. Let's examine what happens when they do.</p>
<p>By analyzing <strong>1,249 running back player-seasons</strong> spanning 2015-2024, we can finally quantify just how bad the first-round RB investment really is. The data reveals three uncomfortable truths: RBs peak almost immediately, decline rapidly, and can be replaced with undrafted free agents who provide <em>better</em> value.</p>
<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR for the impatient:</strong><br />
- <strong>First-round RBs provide near-zero value</strong> (+0.015 avg) during rookie contracts — the worst ROI of any draft round<br />
- <strong>Rounds 2-3 RBs deliver 35x better value</strong> than Round 1 picks (+0.526 and +0.555 vs +0.015)<br />
- <strong>Running backs peak in Year 1-2</strong>, then decline sharply by Year 3 — the shortest career arc of any position<br />
- <strong>Undrafted free agents (UDFAs — players not selected in the draft) outperform drafted RBs</strong> (+0.065 vs -0.016 avg value) — positional replaceability is real<br />
- <strong>Elite first-round RBs are actually value busts</strong>: Christian McCaffrey, Ezekiel Elliott, and Marshawn Lynch all posted negative career value scores despite Pro Bowl production</p>
<h2>The Value Score Methodology</h2>
<p>Before diving into the carnage, here's how we measured "value":</p>
<p><strong>Value Score = Performance Z-Score - Salary Cap % Z-Score</strong></p>
<p>In plain English: We compare each running back's on-field production (rushing yards, touchdowns, receiving stats, efficiency metrics) against their salary as a percentage of the team's salary cap. Players with <strong>positive scores</strong> outperform their contract (bargains), while <strong>negative scores</strong> indicate they're overpaid relative to production.</p>
<p>All analysis focuses on <strong>rookie contract years (years 1-4 post-draft)</strong> when teams have maximum cost control and salary is determined by draft position.</p>
<p><strong>Data sources:</strong> NFL play-by-play data (2015-2024), OverTheCap salary data, Pro Football Reference advanced stats. Minimum 100 snaps/season threshold. Running back position group includes all players classified as RB by NFL rosters.</p>
<h2>Finding #1: First-Round RBs Barely Break Even</h2>
<p><strong>Round 1 running backs average a value score of just +0.015</strong> during their rookie contracts — essentially zero return on investment. Meanwhile, Rounds 2-3 provide <strong>35-50x better ROI</strong>.</p>
<h3>Average Value Score by Draft Round (RB Rookie Contract Years)</h3>
<p><img alt="Bar chart showing average value score by draft round for running backs during rookie contract years.

</table>
<p><strong>Why does Round 1 fail so spectacularly?</strong></p>
<p>First-round RBs command massive rookie salaries due to the NFL's slotted wage scale. The #4 overall pick (Ezekiel Elliott in 2016) earned roughly <strong>$6.26M per year</strong> as a rookie — that's <strong>3.1% of the salary cap</strong>. A Round 3 RB earns closer to <strong>1.0% of the cap</strong>.</p>
<p>Even when first-round RBs produce at a high level, they rarely produce enough to justify costing 3x more than a Round 3 pick who delivers similar yardage. The math simply doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway for teams:</strong> If you draft an RB in Round 1, you're paying premium price for a commodity asset. The data screams to wait until Rounds 2-3, or even later.</p>
<h2>Finding #2: Running Backs Peak Immediately, Then Crater</h2>
<p>Unlike quarterbacks who develop over years, running backs deliver peak value almost immediately after entering the league — then decline precipitously.</p>
<h3>RB Career Arc: Value Score by Years of Experience</h3>
<p><img alt="Line chart showing average value score by years since draft for running backs. Peak occurs at Year 1 with value score of +0.505, stays high in Year 2 at +0.504, then drops sharply to +0.069 in Year 3, continues declining through Year 10. Includes markers showing sample size at each year. Dashed gray line at 0 separates positive from negative value." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/rb_economics/career_arc.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Peak performance occurs in Years 1-2</strong> (+0.505 and +0.504 avg value), coinciding exactly with the rookie contract window. But by Year 3, value has already cratered to +0.069 — a <strong>86% decline</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Running backs have the shortest NFL careers of any position: just 4.2 seasons on average.</strong> This creates a brutal economic reality for teams paying RBs based on past production (Years 1-2) while buying declining assets. By the time an RB reaches a second contract (typically after Year 4), they're already past peak.</p>
<p><strong>Why the rapid decline?</strong></p>
<p>Running back is the most physically punishing position in football. The cumulative effect of 250-300 carries per season takes its toll:<br />
- <strong>Cartilage degradation</strong> in knees and ankles<br />
- <strong>Reduced explosiveness</strong> from repetitive trauma<br />
- <strong>Shorter shelf life</strong> than any other position group</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The old adage "never pay a running back" exists for a reason. You're buying depreciating assets, not appreciating ones.</p>
<h2>Finding #3: The Late-Round Steals Nobody Talks About</h2>

<p><strong>Notice the pattern?</strong> Only 2 of the top 10 came from Round 1-2. The remaining 8 were drafted in <strong>Rounds 3-6</strong>, yet they delivered elite production at bargain contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Howard</strong> (Round 5, Pick 150) is the poster child for RB value: 1,313 rushing yards as a rookie, 1,122 in Year 2, all while earning less than 1% of the salary cap. His career average value score of <strong>+1.159</strong> is nearly <strong>80x better</strong> than the average Round 1 RB.</p>
<p><strong>Kyren Williams</strong> (Round 6, Pick 164) exemplifies modern RB economics: 1,144 rushing yards and 12 TDs in 2023, earning just <strong>$965,000</strong> (0.4% of cap). That's the same production teams pay $15M+ per year for in free agency.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Late-round RB gems aren't flukes — they're systemic. The position is so replaceable that elite production can be found anywhere in the draft.</p>
<h2>Finding #4: Elite First-Round RBs Are Actually Value Busts</h2>
<p>Some of the NFL's most celebrated running backs — Christian McCaffrey, Ezekiel Elliott, Marshawn Lynch — posted <strong>negative career value scores</strong> because their salaries never justified their production. This is the most controversial finding:</p>

<p><strong>Wait, Christian McCaffrey is a "bust"?!</strong></p>
<p>In terms of on-field production, CMC is one of the best RBs of his generation: <strong>2,392 scrimmage yards in 2019</strong>, All-Pro honors, elite receiving ability. But he was drafted #8 overall in 2017, commanding a rookie contract worth <strong>$17.2M over 4 years</strong> (plus a massive second contract).</p>
<p>His value score is negative because <strong>no running back produces enough to justify top-10 draft capital</strong>. The Panthers could have drafted a Round 3 RB for 1/3 the cost and likely gotten 70-80% of CMC's production. That's the cruel math of positional value.</p>
<p>Same story with <strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong> (Pick #4, 2016): League-leading rusher in 2016 and 2018, 3x Pro Bowler, but his $24.9M rookie deal + $90M second contract made him one of the most expensive RBs in NFL history. Could the Cowboys have won more games by spending that capital on an offensive lineman or edge rusher? The data suggests yes.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Even when first-round RBs "hit" on the field, they're often value mistakes. The opportunity cost of not drafting a different position is too high.</p>
<h2>Finding #5: Undrafted RBs Outperform Drafted RBs</h2>
<p>The final nail in the coffin: <strong>Undrafted free agent (UDFA) running backs provide better average value than drafted RBs</strong>.</p>
<h3>Positional Replaceability: Drafted vs. UDFA Running Backs</h3>
<p><img alt="Bar chart comparing average value score between drafted RBs (blue bar at -0.016) and UDFA RBs (orange bar at +0.065). Dashed gray line at 0 separates positive from negative value.

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Undrafted RBs average +0.065 value</strong>, while drafted RBs average <strong>-0.016</strong> — a swing of +0.081 in favor of UDFAs.</p>
<p>How is this possible? Two factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>UDFAs earn near-minimum salaries</strong> ($750k-$1M per year), so even modest production (400-600 yards) generates positive value</li>
<li><strong>Drafted RBs carry salary premiums</strong> that don't match performance, especially in Rounds 1-2</li>
</ol>
<p>Recent UDFA success stories include:<br />
- <strong>Phillip Lindsay</strong> (2018): 1,037 rushing yards, 35 receptions as an UDFA — elite value<br />
- <strong>James Robinson</strong> (2020): 1,070 rushing yards, 49 receptions as an UDFA — one of the best bargains in the league<br />
- <strong>Chuba Hubbard</strong> (drafted Round 4, but similar salary structure): 902 rushing yards on a 4th-round rookie deal</p>
<p><strong>This is the core of the RB replaceability argument</strong>: Why pay premium draft capital and salary for a position where undrafted players provide equal or better ROI?</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Teams can field competent RB rooms by signing UDFAs and late-round picks for a fraction of the cost of a first-rounder.</p>
<h2>Finding #6: Performance and Salary Are Disconnected</h2>
<p><strong>Running back salary shows near-zero correlation with performance</strong> — earning 4% of the cap doesn't predict elite production. The scatter plot below reveals virtually no relationship between career average salary and career average performance across 1,249 player-seasons.</p>
<h3>RB Performance vs. Salary: The Disconnect</h3>
<p><img alt="Scatter plot showing career average performance z-score (y-axis) vs. career average salary as percentage of cap (x-axis) for running backs. Points colored by draft round, sized by total seasons played. Points scattered with no clear positive correlation. Dashed diagonal line shows theoretical perfect correlation. First-round RBs cluster in high salary/low performance quadrant, while late-round RBs cluster in low salary/high performance quadrant." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/rb_economics/performance_vs_salary.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Key observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High salary ≠ high performance</strong>: Many RBs earning 3-4% of the cap post performance z-scores near 0 or negative</li>
<li><strong>Late-round gems cluster in the "high performance, low salary" quadrant</strong> (bottom-right) — these are the bargains</li>
<li><strong>First-round RBs dominate the "high salary, mediocre performance" quadrant</strong> (top-left) — these are the busts</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of correlation confirms what the replaceability data already told us: <strong>RB salaries are determined by draft position and past production, not future value</strong>. Teams are paying for what RBs <em>did</em>, not what they <em>will do</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Don't let past accolades (1,000-yard seasons, Pro Bowls) dictate future salary. Running backs decline rapidly, and yesterday's production doesn't predict tomorrow's.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line: Don't Draft RBs in Round 1</h2>
<p>Let's synthesize all the findings into a simple decision framework:</p>
<p><strong>If you need a running back:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Best ROI</strong>: Wait until <strong>Rounds 3-5</strong> (average value +0.332 to +0.555)</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable risk</strong>: Draft in <strong>Round 2</strong> if an elite prospect falls (+0.526 avg)</li>
<li><strong>Ultra-cheap option</strong>: Sign <strong>UDFAs</strong> and late-round picks (+0.065 avg for UDFAs)</li>
<li><strong>Avoid at all costs</strong>: <strong>Round 1</strong> (+0.015 avg — near-zero value)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you're tempted by a "generational" RB talent in Round 1:</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself: Would I rather have this RB, or a Round 3 RB + a Round 1 defensive lineman/cornerback/offensive tackle? The data overwhelmingly supports the latter.</p>
<p><strong>The Vikings' Dalvin Cook mistake</strong>: Drafted #41 overall in 2017, Cook delivered 6,000+ career rushing yards and 4 Pro Bowls. Yet his total cost (rookie deal + second contract) exceeded <strong>$60M</strong>, and Minnesota cut him in 2023 to save cap space. Meanwhile, Jordan Howard (drafted 109 picks later) delivered comparable early-career production at 1/10th the cost.</p>
<p><strong>The Buccaneers' Doug Martin lesson</strong>: Pick #31 in 2012, Martin rushed for 1,454 yards as a rookie and made 2 Pro Bowls. But his average value score was <strong>-0.968</strong> because his salary consumed too much cap space relative to positional alternatives. Tampa Bay would have been better off drafting a defensive player and signing a mid-tier RB in free agency.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Draft Capital Is Too Precious</h2>
<p>Running backs matter. No one disputes that elite rushing attacks win games. But the economics are brutal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shortest career arcs</strong> of any position (peak in Years 1-2, decline by Year 3)</li>
<li><strong>Highest replaceability</strong> (UDFAs provide better value than drafted RBs)</li>
<li><strong>Worst Round 1 ROI</strong> of any position group (+0.015 avg value)</li>
<li><strong>Best value in Rounds 3-5</strong> (+0.555, +0.526, +0.404 avg)</li>
</ul>
<p>NFL draft capital is scarce. First-round picks are currency. Spending that currency on a position that:<br />
- Peaks immediately<br />
- Declines rapidly<br />
- Can be replaced with UDFAs</p>
<p>...is a market inefficiency that smart teams have already corrected. The analytics community has been right all along: <strong>Don't draft running backs in Round 1</strong>.</p>
<p>Save that pick for a cornerstone position (QB, OT, EDGE, CB) and find your RB1 in Round 3. Your cap flexibility and win total will thank you.</p>
