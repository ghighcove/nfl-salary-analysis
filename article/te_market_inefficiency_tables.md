## Table 5: Blocking vs Receiving TE Value Comparison

| TE Type | Avg Value Score | Sample Size | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Receiving TEs** (4+ targets/game) | **+0.032** | 280 seasons | Positive value |
| **Blocking TEs** (<4 targets/game) | **-0.014** | 780 seasons | Negative value |
| **Difference** | **+0.046** | | Receiving TEs deliver better ROI |

**Key takeaway:** Teams should prioritize pass-catching ability when drafting TEs. Blocking can be found cheaper elsewhere (veteran TEs, extra OL).
