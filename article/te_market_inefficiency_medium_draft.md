Every NFL draft, teams face a critical decision: When should we draft a tight end? The conventional wisdom suggests waiting until Day 2 or Day 3, but the data reveals something more nuanced — **Round 2 tight ends provide exceptional value**, while first-round picks carry significant bust risk.

By analyzing **1,063 tight end player-seasons** spanning 2015-2024, we can quantify exactly where draft capital should be allocated. The findings challenge the narrative that elite tight ends must be drafted early and reveal why George Kittle (Round 5, Pick 146), Sam LaPorta (Round 2, Pick 34), and Dalton Schultz (Round 4, Pick 137) represent systemic market inefficiencies, not flukes.

## Key Findings

**TL;DR for the impatient:**
- **Round 2 TEs deliver highest draft ROI** (+0.582 avg value) — even better than Round 1 (+0.353)
- **Round 5 TEs are the second-best value play** (+0.530 avg) — elite production at minimum cost
- **Tight ends peak in Years 1-2**, then provide positive value through Year 6 — longer career arcs than running backs
- **First-round TEs have 60% bust rate** — 6 of 10 lowest-value first-rounders delivered negative career value
- **Receiving TEs provide better value than blocking TEs** (+0.032 vs -0.014) — teams should prioritize pass-catching ability
- **Red zone efficiency justifies elite TE salaries** — Travis Kelce and Mark Andrews earn their premium through touchdown production

## The Value Score Methodology

Before diving into the analysis, here's how we measured "value":

**Value Score = Performance Z-Score - Salary Cap % Z-Score**

In plain English: We compare each tight end's on-field production (receiving yards, touchdowns, receptions, efficiency metrics) against their salary as a percentage of the team's salary cap. Players with **positive scores** outperform their contract (bargains), while **negative scores** indicate they're overpaid relative to production.

All analysis focuses on **rookie contract years (years 0-3 post-draft)** when teams have maximum cost control and salary is determined by draft position.

**Data sources:** NFL play-by-play data (2015-2024), OverTheCap salary data, Pro Football Reference advanced stats. Minimum 100 snaps/season threshold. Tight end position group includes all players classified as TE by NFL rosters.

## Finding #1: Round 2 TEs Are the Draft's Best Value Play

**Round 2 tight ends average a value score of +0.582** during their rookie contracts — the highest ROI of any draft round. Meanwhile, Round 1 TEs provide only +0.353 average value despite costing 2-3x more in salary.

### Average Value Score by Draft Round (TE Rookie Contract Years)

Round 2 shows highest value at +0.58 in green, Round 5 at +0.53 in green, Round 3 at +0.45 in orange, Round 4 at +0.41 in orange, Round 1 at +0.35 in orange, Round 6 at +0.23 in orange, and Round 7 at +0.10 in orange. A dashed gray line at 0 separates positive from negative value.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/draft_roi_by_round.png)

![Table: Draft ROI by Round showing average value scores for TEs by draft round](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/table_1_draft_roi.png)

**Why does Round 2 dominate?**

Round 2 TEs hit the sweet spot: They're talented enough to earn draft capital but cheap enough to provide surplus value. The #40 overall pick (early Round 2) earns roughly **$2.5M per year** as a rookie — that's **1.25% of the salary cap**. A Round 1 TE drafted #10 overall earns closer to **$5M per year** (2.5% of cap).

Even when Round 1 TEs produce at a high level, they rarely produce enough to justify costing 2x more than a Round 2 pick who delivers similar yardage. The math doesn't work.

**Round 5 as the ultimate value hack:**

Round 5 TEs earn near-minimum salaries (**~$800k per year**, or 0.4% of cap), so even modest production (400-500 yards, 3-4 TDs) generates elite value scores. George Kittle (Pick 146), Dalton Schultz (Pick 137), and Tyler Higbee (Pick 110) exemplify this market inefficiency — 1,000-yard seasons on rookie minimum contracts.

**Takeaway for teams:** If you need a tight end, wait for Round 2. If you're willing to develop, Round 5 offers exceptional upside at near-zero cost. Avoid Round 1 unless you're certain the prospect is generational.

## Finding #2: Tight Ends Peak in Years 1-2, But Provide Longer Value Windows Than RBs

**Tight ends peak in Years 1-2, then maintain positive value through Year 6** — a significantly longer value window than running backs (who go negative by Year 4).

### TE Career Arc: Value Score by Years of Experience

![Line chart showing average value score by years since draft for tight ends. Peak occurs at Year 2 with value score of +0.68, followed by Year 1 at +0.66, Year 0 at +0.43, then gradual decline through Year 10. Includes markers showing sample size at each year. Dashed gray line at 0 separates positive from negative value.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/career_arc.png)

![Table: TE Career Arc showing value score by years of experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/table_2_career_arc.png)

**Peak performance occurs in Years 1-2** (+0.664 and +0.683 avg value), coinciding exactly with the rookie contract window. But unlike running backs (who go negative by Year 4), tight ends maintain positive value through Year 6 — an extra 2-3 years of surplus production.

**Why the extended value window?**

Tight ends develop slower than running backs due to the complexity of the position:
- **Route-running** requires time to master NFL defensive coverages
- **Blocking technique** takes 1-2 years to refine against elite edge rushers
- **Chemistry with QB** builds gradually over seasons

This creates an exploitable market inefficiency: Teams can draft TEs in Rounds 2-5, develop them for 1-2 years, then reap 4-5 years of elite production before second contracts kick in.

**Takeaway:** Tight ends are better long-term bets than running backs. The position provides 6+ years of positive value instead of 3-4, making them more suitable for roster-building strategies that prioritize sustained competitiveness.

## Finding #3: The Late-Round TE Steals Nobody Talks About

While first-round busts make headlines, late-round TE gems consistently deliver elite ROI. Here are the **top 10 tight end bargains** by career average value score (minimum 2 seasons):

### Top 10 TE Bargains (Career Average Value)

![Horizontal bar chart showing top 10 tight end bargains ranked by career average value score. Sam LaPorta leads at +2.46 (Round 2, Pick 34), followed by Tucker Kraft at +1.45 (Round 3, Pick 78), Trey McBride at +1.42 (Round 2, Pick 55), Isaiah Likely at +1.37 (Round 5, Pick 139), Cade Otton at +1.36 (Round 4, Pick 106), and five others. Bars colored by draft round using green gradient.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/top_bargains.png)

![Table: Top 10 TE bargains ranked by career average value score](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/table_3_top_bargains.png)

**Notice the pattern?** **7 of the top 10 came from Rounds 2-3**, and only 1 came from Round 1. The remaining 2 were late-round picks (Round 5 and UDFA).

**Sam LaPorta** (Round 2, Pick 34) is the poster child for TE value: **889 receiving yards and 10 TDs** as a rookie in 2023, earning just **$1.6M per year** (0.75% of cap). His career average value score of **+2.463** is **7x better** than the average Round 1 TE.

**Isaiah Likely** (Round 5, Pick 139) exemplifies late-round TE value: **411 receiving yards and 5 TDs** in 2023 while earning **$900k per year** (0.42% of cap). That's the same production teams pay $8-10M+ per year for in free agency.

**George Kittle's absence from the top 10** is notable — despite being a Round 5 steal (Pick 146), his elite production eventually justified a massive second contract ($15M+ per year), dragging his career average value score down. This highlights an important nuance: Elite TEs become expensive, but teams get them cheap for 4-5 years first.

**Takeaway:** Round 2-3 TEs aren't flukes — they're systemic. The position develops slowly enough that elite talent slips past Round 1, creating value opportunities on Day 2.

## Finding #4: First-Round TEs Are High-Risk, Low-Reward

This is the most sobering finding: **60% of first-round TEs** in our dataset posted negative career value scores or barely broke even. Some of the NFL's most celebrated tight ends cost their teams more than they provided.

### Top 10 First-Round TE Busts (Career Average Value)

Bars colored by draft pick number using red gradient.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/top_busts.png)

![Table: Top 10 first-round TE busts with negative career value scores](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/table_4_top_busts.png)

**Wait, T.J. Hockenson is a "bust"?!**

In terms of on-field production, Hockenson is one of the best TEs of his generation: **2x Pro Bowler**, **670+ receiving yards per season**, elite route-running. But he was drafted #8 overall in 2019, commanding a rookie contract worth **$20.5M over 4 years** (plus a second contract extension).

His value score is negative because **no tight end produces enough to justify top-10 draft capital**. The Lions could have drafted a Round 2 TE for 1/2 the cost and likely gotten 70-80% of Hockenson's production. That's the cruel math of positional value.

Same story with **Kyle Pitts** (Pick #4, 2021): Generational athleticism, 1,026 receiving yards as a rookie, but his $32.9M rookie deal made him one of the most expensive TEs in NFL history relative to cap %. Could the Falcons have won more games by spending that capital on an edge rusher or offensive tackle? The data suggests yes.

**Eric Ebron** is the cautionary tale: Pick #10 in 2014, Ebron posted **769 yards and 13 TDs** in 2018 (a Pro Bowl season), yet his average career value was **-1.782** — one of the worst in our dataset. Why? His $8.25M rookie contract + inconsistency in Detroit made him a net negative asset despite flashes of excellence.

**Takeaway:** Even when first-round TEs "hit" on the field, they're often value mistakes. The opportunity cost of not drafting a different position is too high.

## Finding #5: Red Zone Efficiency Justifies Elite TE Salaries

**Elite tight ends who convert 15%+ of targets into touchdowns justify their premium salaries** — while mid-tier TEs earning 2-3% of cap rarely provide positive value. Touchdown efficiency per target is the clearest differentiator between worth-the-cost TEs and overpaid mediocrity.

### TE Red Zone Efficiency vs. Salary: The Correlation

![Scatter plot showing touchdowns per target (x-axis) vs. salary as percentage of cap (y-axis) for tight ends. Points colored by value score (green = positive value, red = negative value). Elite TEs cluster in high TD/target, high salary, positive value quadrant (top-right). Minimum 20 targets required.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/redzone_vs_salary.png)

**Key observations:**

- **Elite TDs per target (>0.15)** justify higher salaries — Travis Kelce, Mark Andrews, and Rob Gronkowski cluster in the "high efficiency, high salary, positive value" quadrant
- **Mid-tier TEs (0.08-0.12 TDs/target)** earning 2-3% of cap mostly post negative value — teams overpay for mediocrity
- **Low TD rates (<0.08)** correlate with negative value regardless of salary — blocking TEs and possession receivers don't justify premium contracts

**Why does red zone efficiency matter so much?**

Touchdowns are the most valuable stat in football. A TE who converts 15% of targets into TDs (roughly 1 TD every 7 targets) is exponentially more valuable than one who converts 8% (1 TD every 12 targets). The difference is 3-4 additional TDs per season — worth roughly **12-16 expected points** in EPA terms.

**Travis Kelce** exemplifies this: Career 0.13 TDs per target, earning 3-4% of cap, yet posting positive career value scores because **his red zone production justifies the premium**. He's not overpaid — he's appropriately priced for his impact.

**Takeaway:** If you're going to pay a TE top-5 money, make sure they convert targets into touchdowns at an elite rate (>0.12 TDs/target). Possession receivers who rack up yards but don't score are value traps.

## Finding #6: Receiving TEs Provide Better Value Than Blocking TEs

**Tight ends who average 4+ targets per game** (receiving TEs) provide better value than blocking-first TEs — and it's not even close.

### Blocking vs. Receiving TE Value Comparison

![Bar chart comparing average value score between blocking TEs (orange bar at -0.014) and receiving TEs (green bar at +0.032). Dashed gray line at 0 separates positive from negative value. Sample sizes shown: Blocking TEs n=780, Receiving TEs n=280.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/blocking_vs_receiving.png)

![Table: Blocking vs Receiving TEs average value score comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghighcove/nfl-salary-analysis/master/article/images/te_market_inefficiency/table_5_role_comparison.png)

**Receiving TEs average +0.032 value**, while blocking TEs average **-0.014** — a swing of **+0.046** in favor of pass-catching specialists.

**How is this possible?**

Two factors:

1. **Receiving TEs earn similar salaries but produce more impact stats** — yards and touchdowns are more valuable than blocks in EPA/win probability models
2. **Blocking TEs are replaceable by offensive linemen or fullbacks** — teams don't need to pay TE salaries for blocking ability they can get elsewhere

Recent receiving TE success stories:
- **Sam LaPorta** (2023): 889 yards, 10 TDs on a Round 2 rookie contract — +2.463 value
- **Trey McBride** (2023-2024): 825 yards per season on a Round 2 rookie deal — +1.423 value
- **Dalton Kincaid** (2023-2024): 673 yards, 4.5 TDs per season on Round 2 contract — +1.287 value

**The blocking TE trap:**

Teams often draft TEs in Rounds 1-3 with the justification that "he's an elite blocker and can contribute immediately." But blocking TEs rarely justify their draft capital or salary relative to pass-catchers. If you need blocking, sign a veteran TE for $2-3M or use an extra offensive lineman in heavy sets.

**Takeaway:** Prioritize pass-catching ability when drafting tight ends. Blocking is a nice bonus, but it shouldn't drive the decision. Teams can find blocking elsewhere for cheaper.

## The Bottom Line: Draft TEs in Round 2, Develop Them, Reap 5+ Years of Value

Let's synthesize all the findings into a simple decision framework:

**If you need a tight end:**

1. **Best overall ROI**: Draft in **Round 2** (+0.582 avg value — highest of any round)
2. **Elite value hack**: Take a chance in **Round 5** (+0.530 avg) — George Kittle proves this works
3. **Solid depth**: **Rounds 3-4** (+0.452 and +0.411 avg) provide consistent production
4. **Avoid at all costs**: **Round 1** (+0.353 avg — high bust rate, low value ceiling)

**If you're tempted by a "generational" TE talent in Round 1:**

Ask yourself: Would I rather have this TE, or a Round 2 TE + a Round 1 EDGE/CB/OT? The data overwhelmingly supports the latter.

**The Lions' Sam LaPorta success**: Drafted #34 overall in 2023 (Round 2), LaPorta delivered **889 yards and 10 TDs** as a rookie while earning $1.6M per year. His value score of +2.463 is nearly **7x better** than the average first-round TE. Detroit got elite production at bargain cost — exactly what the data predicts.

**The Falcons' Kyle Pitts caution**: Pick #4 in 2021, Pitts rushed for 1,026 yards as a rookie and showcased generational athleticism. But his $32.9M rookie deal + inconsistent usage since has resulted in a **-0.631 career value score**. Could Atlanta have drafted a Round 2 TE and spent Pick #4 on a defensive player? The data suggests yes.

**The 49ers' George Kittle masterclass**: Pick #146 in 2017 (Round 5), Kittle developed for 1 year, then exploded for **1,377 yards in 2018** while earning $745k per year (0.37% of cap). San Francisco got 3 years of elite production (2018-2020) before paying him market rate in 2021. That's how you exploit the TE value window.

## Conclusion: Tight Ends Are Market Inefficiencies Worth Exploiting

Tight ends matter. Elite receiving TEs like Travis Kelce and George Kittle change offenses. But the economics are clear:

- **Longest value windows** of any skill position (6+ years of positive value)
- **Best draft ROI in Round 2** (+0.582 avg value)
- **Elite value in Round 5** (+0.530 avg — near-minimum salaries)
- **Worst Round 1 bust rate** (60% fail to justify top-32 draft capital)
- **Receiving TEs >> Blocking TEs** (+0.032 vs -0.014 avg value)

NFL draft capital is scarce. First-round picks are currency. Spending that currency on a position that:
- Develops slowly (peaks in Year 2)
- Can be found in Round 2-5
- Provides 6+ years of surplus value when drafted later

...is a market inefficiency that smart teams exploit. The analytics community is right: **Draft tight ends on Day 2, not Day 1**.

Wait for Round 2, draft a pass-catching specialist, develop them for 1-2 years, then reap 4-5 years of elite production before second contracts kick in. Your cap flexibility and win total will thank you.
